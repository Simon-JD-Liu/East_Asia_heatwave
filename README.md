# Overview
This repository contains the R code used for the main analysis presented in the article, "Nonlinear Exposure-Response Associations of Daytime, Nighttime, and Day-Night Compound Heatwaves with Mortality Amid Climate Change."

Here, we provide the analysis code for all-cause mortality in East Asia. The codes for region-specific and cause-specific analyses are nearly identical to the publicly available code provided here.

# Usage
To use the script, ensure that the required datasets are available and all necessary dependencies are installed in your R environment.

# Acknowledgments
The code used here is heavily based on the code used for the analysis in the paper "Mortality risk attributable to high and low ambient temperature: a multi-country study" by Antonio Gasparrini, et al (The Lancet, 2015).
We downloaded their code from here: [https://github.com/gasparrini/2015_gasparrini_Lancet_Rcodedata](https://github.com/gasparrini/2015_gasparrini_Lancet_Rcodedata) and then edited them as needed for our analysis.
